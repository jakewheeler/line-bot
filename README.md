# Line Bot

This project is a Line chat bot that I created for my group chat.

## Running the Bot

### API Keys

To get started, you will need your own API keys from:

- [Line](https://developers.line.biz/en/)
- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
- [BreweryDB](https://www.brewerydb.com/)
- [fixer.io](https://fixer.io/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Lunch Money](https://lunchmoney.app/)

All API keys can be had for free (besides Lunch Money, which you should pay for!)

### Running Locally

1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies (recommended to do this in a virtual environment)
2. Obtain API keys and place them into your file called `.env`, which should look similar to the example file in this repository
3. In the main function of `bot.py` replace the variable called `test_text` with the command of your choice
4. Run `python bot.py` to test your command

### Deployment

For info on deployment, check out Line's guide on [building a bot](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/building-bot/). Line recommends using Heroku, which is what this project is using.

Note that when deploying, your server will need to run the following script:

`python app.py`

If running on a Heroku Dyno, there is no need to modify the Procfile included in this repository.
